OpenBench Workshop 2022 (Sunday, November 6th, 2022, Virtual)

With the continuous development of the global open source ecosystem, it has witnessed the explosive growth of various event data generated by rich open source ecological activities. We collectively refer to it as open source ecological big data, which can support very rich tasks at different levels, from system tasks, to algorithm tasks, to applications and business, forming a complete benchmark hierarchy. OpenBench workshop invites researchers and practitioners from industry, academia, associations, and government organizations to explore this cutting-edge direction, including but not limit to the topics around OSS metrology and measurement methods, OSS measurement data standards, quality and governance, definition and classification of OSS ecological benchmarks, OpenBench standard datasets and analysis tasks, OpenBench indicator system and benchmarking system, application scenarios and cases of open source ecological benchmarking, Interdisciplinary theory of open source ecological benchmarking, Data-driven open source skills measurement and open source education evaluation, etc.
